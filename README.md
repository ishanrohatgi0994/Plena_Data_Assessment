Directions to run code on Windows Platform
1. Make sure to enter the 'working directory' where python is installed (make sure to check version) code is downloaded.

      Example-: 'C:\python36\python.exe'

2. type the 'location directory' of where this code was downloaded to run the python script.

      Example-: 'Z:\code\hw01\filename(here = String_Formatting).py'

3. Prompt will ask user to enter string

4. Hit enter to view results

Case-wise Assumptions taken into account-:
1) If no non-repeating character is present, no modifications are done to the string. Example-: 'abcabc', all characters appear twice.
2) The string is returned to the user by sorting first based on frequency of occurence, then based on which character came first in the original string. Example-: custom string 'Bubblele' would be represented as 'ulleeBbb' as character 'u' has frequency 1, character 'l' has frequency 2 and comes before character 'e' in the original string which also has frequency 2.
